### No Stimulus Check

Didn’t receive a stimulus check in 2020?  Don’t know how to get one?  File a tax return!  If the IRS was not able to find you last year to send you a stimulus payment for 2020, you can claim any stimulus you did not receive by filing a 2020 tax return and reclaiming an Economic Recovery Credit.  If you have already filed a return and now have realized you did not receive a stimulus payment, then you can claim a stimulus payment you are due by reporting an Economic Recovery Credit on an amended return.  If you find yourself in one of these situations and need help, please contact me.  I can help.
