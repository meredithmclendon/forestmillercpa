### Why You Should File Series - Get Your Refund

Haven’t filed in a tax return in a while and have a refund?  Don’t lose your refund!  The IRS only allows two years from a return’s due date for a person to file a return to claim a refund.  Consequently, if you do not file a return on time and think you will claim your refund later, you could lose your refund if you wait too long.  Contact me today and I will help you get your money.
