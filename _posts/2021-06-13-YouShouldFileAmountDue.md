### Why You Should File Series - Amount Due

Haven’t filed a tax return in a while and owe money? Let me tell you why you should file.  When a return is delinquent, the Internal Revenue Code provides for a failure to file penalty of 5% a month up to a total of 25% of the amount due. The Code also provides for a failure to pay penalty of .5% a month up to a total of 25% of the amount due.  Finally, interest continues to accrue daily on all tax, penalty, and interest due until paid.  Therefore, the sooner you file or settle up with the IRS, the less you will have to pay. Don’t wait until the IRS tracks you down and sends you a collection letter.  If you are behind in your taxes and want to get current but don’t know how to, contact me.  I can help.
